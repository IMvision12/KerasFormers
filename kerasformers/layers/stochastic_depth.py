class StochasticDepth(layers.Layer):
    """
    Implements the Stochastic Depth regularization layer, which randomly drops
    paths (connections) during training to prevent overfitting. This is typically
    used in deep networks to make them more robust and reduce overfitting.

    Args:
        drop_path_rate (float): Probability of dropping a path. Should be between 0 and 1.
        seed (int, optional): Seed for the drop-mask RNG. Backed by a Keras
            ``SeedGenerator`` so the random op stays valid under JAX ``jit``.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the `Layer` class.

    Methods:
        call(x, training=None):
            Applies the stochastic depth mechanism during training by randomly dropping
            some of the connections with a probability defined by `drop_path_rate`. During
            inference, the input is returned unchanged.

        get_config():
            Returns a dictionary containing the configuration of the layer, including the
            `drop_path_rate`.

    Example:
        >>> layer = StochasticDepth(drop_path_rate=0.1)
        >>> output = layer(input_tensor, training=True)
